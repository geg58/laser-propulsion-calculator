* Changed Laser Comm Photon Rate at Earth Received in Array units to ph/s
* Add input: Laser Comm Wavelength (nm) after Peak Laser Comm Power (W)
* Add input: Default Laser Comm Beam Efficiency to 1. The multiply Laser Comm Flux at Earth by Laser Comm Beam Efficiency
* Add input: Photons per bit for communication (ph/bit) after Peak Laser Comm Power (W)
* Add output: Bit rate received at Earth  (units will be bits/s) = Laser Comm Rate at Earth Received in Array/ Photons per bit for communication (ph/bit) after Laser Comm Rate at Earth Received in Array
Note I replaced "lambda (main high power laser) wavelength with Laser Comm Wavelength (nm) below to allow for a different laser comm wavelength that the main high power laser in the drive array.
* Change output: Laser_comm_spacecraft_power_peak= peak laser comm power in watts
* Change output: Laser_comm_spacecraft_optics_size= spacecraft laser comm optical size lambda_laser_comm_wavelength(nm)
* Change output: Laser Comm Flux at Earth (ph/s-m^2)= epsilon_sub_laser_comm_beam_eff*
 [Laser Comm Spacecraft Transmit Power (w)/(h*c/( lambda_laser_comm_wavelength(nm)*10^-9 )]/{[L_target_m*2* lambda_laser_comm_wavelength(nm)*10^-9 /Laser Comm Transmit Optics Size (m)]^2}
Change output formula: Laser Comm Rate at Earth Received in Array(ph/s)= Laser Comm Flux at Earth (ph/s-m^2)*[(d_array_size)^2]
Change output formula: Laser Comm_effective_photometric_magnitude = -2.5* log (Laser Comm Flux at Earth (ph/s-m^2)/3x1010)
